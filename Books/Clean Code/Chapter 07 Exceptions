Chapter 6 Object and Data Structures 



Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.


Object 



Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions

Law of Demeter says 
	method f of class C should only call the methods of these: 
		- C
		- An object created by f
		- An object passed as an argument to f
		- An object held in an instance variable of C


Train Wrecks 
	
	//bad 
	String outputdir = context.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();
		-looks like a train when some thing goes wrong 

    //better
	 databaseOptions options = context.getOptions();
	 File scrathDirectory = options.getScratchDir();
	 String outputdir = scrathDirectory.getAbsolutePath();

Be a Object or be a Data Structure but don't be both at the same time. 

Very complex objects might need a DTO for mapping them to the database but, 
with EF with code first can now directly map to backing feilds and there is not a need to a seperate DTO for Saving data.
