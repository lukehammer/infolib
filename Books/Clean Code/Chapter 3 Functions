Chaper 3 -- Functions 


Small.
	--no smaller then that!

Do one thing.
	-- "Functions should do one thing . They should do it well. They should so it only."

One level of abstraction per function. 

Switch staments 
	--It's hard to make a small switch statment.
	--General rule for Switch statments can be tolerated if they appear only one add are used to create polymorphic objects
	and are hidden behind an inheritance relationship. 


Use descriptive names.
	i
Arguments.
	Best to worse 

	1. niladic -- no arguments 
	2. monadic -- one argument
	3. dyadic -- two arguments 
	4. triadic -- three arguments
	5. polyadic -- more then three   **needs very special justification**


Flag Arguments 
	--Very bad practice 
			-- If used clear that function is doing more than one thing. 
			-- Split method into several independent methods that can be called from the client without the flag.


Have no side effects.


Command Query Seperation 
	--do something or answer something, But not both. 

Prefer Exceptions to Returning Error Codes

D.R.Y.
	--Don't Repeat  Yourself

Structured Programming 
	--Multiple return, break, continue - OK, but GOTO should always be avoided.
